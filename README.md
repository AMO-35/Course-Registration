Question 2: Discuss how you manages the state in your assignment project

Answer:

The state hook is utilized in this project. This state is used by me for conditional rendering and state management. It was also utilized for flag toggles. similar to 'isExist', which is used to add courses based on credit limit. It is then utilized as a counter to count the entire number of credits before counting the remaining credits, further added. I also store api data in state as a last step.
